The game is played by using the ghost, Blinky, to chase after the Pac-Man. The Pac-Man runs around eating pellets. The game can be paused, resumed, and reloaded when the game is over. The game ends when either Blinky or Pac-Man catches each other, or when the Pac-Man eats all the pellets on the board.
